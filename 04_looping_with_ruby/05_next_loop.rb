Next!
The next keyword can be used to skip over certain steps in the loop. 
For instance, if we donâ€™t want to print out the even numbers, we can write:

for i in 1..5
  next if i % 2 == 0
  print i
end

In the above example, we loop through the range of 1 through 5, 
assigning each number to i in turn.
If the remainder of i / 2 is zero, we go to the next iteration of the loop.
Then we print the value of i. This line prints out 1, 3, and 5 because of the previous line.
=end

i = 20
loop do
  i -= 1
  next if i % 2 != 0
  print "#{i}"
  break if i <= 0
end
