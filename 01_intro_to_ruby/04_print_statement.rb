# The print commands takes whatever you give it and prints it to the console

# "puts" for "put string" is slightly different
# puts adds a new blank line after the thing you want it to print 

# Notice you do not need any parentheses or semi-colons!

puts "Hello"
print "Sonia"
print "Test!"

# Output:
# Hello
# SoniaTest!
