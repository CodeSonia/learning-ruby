# Single-line comments
# Writing good comments not only clarifies your code for other people, but it also reminds you of what you were trying to do

# this is a single-line comment

# Multi-line comments
# If you start with =begin and end with =end, everything between those two expressions will be a comment.

=begin
This is an example of a 
Multi-line comment!
As you can see, I don't need to use # 
on every single line! 
=end
